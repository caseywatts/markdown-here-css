Casey's custom css for Markdown-Here http://markdown-here.com/

### Setup
Go to the settings page for the markdown-here Chrome Extension.
In the field "primary styling", paste-append the contents of the file `default.css` in this repo.

### Markdown-Here Updates
Markdown-here periodically updates their css to be more cross-browser compatible and standard. I put my overrides at the bottom of their default styling, but there may be conflicts - double-check it looks how you'd like before sending :)

### Troubleshooting
If something looks funny, try their default first and then try these additions one at a time.

### Cross-Client Compatibilitiy
This css is primarily targeted at gmail users (like the students at Yale university). The rounded-borders headers that look so sleek don't work in every email client.
